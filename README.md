# Tools for download chromedriver


## Motivation

I did some robots and scrapers that require chromedriver. There are packages for automatically downloading chromedriver (e.g: https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/), but I prefer to have control over the process (personal preferences :-)).

This tool helps me list/download the specific version I want. (It's a command line tool, NO GUI available)


See Chromedriver page https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ for availables endpoints
